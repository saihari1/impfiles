In Ansible,

create master and nodes.

after that perform these in nodes
      
	sudo useradd ansible
	sudo passwd ansible
	sudo visudo
	sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd-cnfg
 	sudo systemctl restart sshd

Connect to master and perform these

	ssh-keygen
	try to copy the keys to nodes using    ssh-copy-id username@private ip of node1
					       ssh-copy-id username@private ip of node2

add node ips to the host file  "sudo vi /etc/ansible/hosts"

Test the nodes once by connecting "ssh private ip"

run the adhoc commands if they are not performed/permission denied. Manually copy the key in the nodes.

			cd .ssh/
			copy the pub key
                        paste this same key in the nodes(.ssh/authorised keys)















ansible all -b -m command -a "amazon-linux-extras install -y docker"
