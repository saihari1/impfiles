Ansible roles:

Ansible roles are reusable, modular collections of Ansible resources that group related automation artifacts like tasks, variables, templates, and handlers into a standardized file structure. 

They are defined using YAML files and have a predefined directory structure.

>> They provide a skeleton for independent and reusable collections of variables, tasks, templates , files 
   
   and modules which can be automatically loaded into the playbooks.

To create a role using galaxy we can use the following commands:

>> ansible-galaxy init <role name>

If we want to use the roles created by others, then we have to go to ansible galaxy.

>> ansible-galaxy search <toolsyou want to install>

>> ansible-galaxy install <author>.<rolename>
