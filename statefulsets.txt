Why is this identity is necessary in statefulsets ?

>>  It is useful for scaling database apps.

>> It has master and slaves config.

>> Master has both read and write access but the slaves has only read access.

>> These slaves always in sync with the data updated by master.

>> Each master and slaves use their own volumes but not shared physical storage.

>> Whenever a new pod gets created then it clones the data from the previous pod and in sync with the master.

>> In stateful sets if we mentions 3 replicas, then initially 1 replica is created if that that replica is up and     

   running then only remaining replicas are created .

>> Re plicas are created only based on the state of previous pod. If it's in pending/not created then the replicas 

   won't be created.
 


  		Ex:   Deletion/ scaledown of statefulsets  take from last pod

			suppose if we have 3 pods , they get deleted in the order 3>2>1.
