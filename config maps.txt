config maps & secrets 


Kubernetes RBAC is a key security control to ensure that cluster users and workloads have only the access to resources required to execute their roles.



> config maps can be used to store data. This data can be later used by the pods.

>  Config Maps in Kubernetes are designed to hold configuration data for your Pods. They are API objects that contain key-value pairs.


Why would you use a ConfigMap in Kubernetes?

Use a ConfigMap to keep your application code separate from your configuration.


> if you have non sensitive data storing in config maps is best preferred.

> if you have sensitive data, you have to store it in secrets.

Both configmaps and secrets are used to store or pass the info. secrets are encrypted as they have sensitive data & they enforce a strong RBAC(Role Based Access Control).
